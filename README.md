## About The Project

  <a href="https://github.com/tedtay/CS-GO-Pro-Matches-Comprehensive-Dataset">
    <img src="data_screenshot.png" alt="Logo" >
  </a>


</br>This project aims to help further our understanding of FPS eSports by providing a comprehensive dataset containing (almost) all CS:GO Pro games. I encourage all interested Data Analyst/Scientists, ML Engineers, Data Engineers, hobbyists and so on to play around with the dataset, create models, analyse niche areas and share your findings back with the eSports and data community.

## Overview Of The Data 

The dataset has a shape of **(126872, 155)** meaning 126872 games have been recorded and 155 different data points (features) have been logged for each game. This is a reasonably large ammount of data so the .csv file is approximatly 87Mb.

Please see the **SWEETVIZ_REPORT.html** file for a summary of many of the features.

The dataset contains data from pro **games**, this is slightly different from what the title of the repo suggests as CS:GO matches usually  consist of two teams playing a best of three games.



<!-- CONTRIBUTING --></br>
## Collecting The Data 



This data was scraped from HLTV using Selenium and BeautifulSoup running in Python with on Chrome. Please see **main_gcp_vm.py** for the script I created for this. This script was ran inside a GCP VM for 12 days until all pages on HLTV.org had been collected. The script produces three **.csv** files which are described below.

* **historic_games_list.csv** - A list of the games and their corresponding web page along with some basic game info.

* **game_data.csv** - A comprehensive list of game data taken from the individual game web pages.
* **exception_data** - A list showing all exceptions that occurred in the 12 days of running. Out of ~127k games only 452 pages couldn't be loaded and therefore were skipped.


</br>

Finally, the **historic_games_list.csv** and **game_data.csv** have been merged, cleaned and a few additional features extracted which has produced the **csgp_pro_games_data.csv** file.
